<h1 style="margin-top:-10px;"><span class="textbg">ABOUT</span></h1>
	I am Cheng-i Wang, currently a Ph.D student in UCSD computer music started 2013 fall.

	<br />
<br />

	My research interest is to analyze/generate music with content-based analysis by machine learning, digital signal processing and information theoretic approaches.
	Current research topic is phrase/gesture recognition and structural music segmentation with supervised learning.   

	<br />
<br />
	Apart from academic activities, I am a composer, sound/projection/live image processing designer for theatrical performances.
